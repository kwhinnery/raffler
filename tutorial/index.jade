      ## Configuration

      The first file we'll look at is `config.json`. This contains high-level configuration information about your tutorial. This JSON file contains several properties you can declare about your tutorial:

      * `title`: This is the title of your tutorial which will show on the first page
      * `description`: This is a string of text that will appear above the "Start" button for your tutorial.
      * `repo`: This is the GitHub repo that your code lives in. Right now we assume all projects are hosted there, but we'll likely make this agnostic in the future.
      * `heroku`: This indicates whether or not your project supports instant deployment with the [Heroku Button](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/8/7/heroku-button)

      Now, let's take a look at the first file that contains the actual content of the tutorial, `index.jade`.
